\section{Are You Getting Stairs?} 
                                  

Most building codes have very specific restrictions on how a staircase
can be designed. Here are typical restrictions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The stair-step height can be at most $7\frac{3}{4}''$. 
\item The stair-step depth must be at least $10''$.
\item These dimensions cannot not change (in real-life there is a minimum tolerance for variance in these dimensions). 
\end{enumerate}

Let's lay some stairs! While there are several approaches to this
problem, I'm going to suggest we use the following friendly matrix:
\[
\mat{D}_{s,t}= 
\begin{bmatrix}
s & 0 & 0 \\
0 & t & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This is a geometric transformation that will dilate (scale) a picture
by a factor of $s$ in the horizontal direction and a factor of $t$ in
the vertical direction. We'll use this to transform a ``generic'' stair case of $n$ stairs to fit our needs:
\[

\]
The upshot is that in essence, to lay a staircase of $n$ stairs that
is up to code in a space that is $w$ feet wide and $h$ feet tall, you
must solve the following equation:
\[
\mat{D}_{s,t}
\begin{bmatrix}
n \\
n \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
w \\
h \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where 
$s\le \frac{31}{48}$ and $t\ge \frac{5}{6}$.

\begin{prob}
Where do the numbers 
\[
\frac{31}{48}\qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{5}{6}
\]
come from?
