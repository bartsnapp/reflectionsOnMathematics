\section{How Many?} 
                                  

In this activity, we'll investigate how many symmetries a regular
$n$-gon has.  To start off, let's remember what it means for
something to have symmetry. Roughly speaking, an object has symmetry
if you can do something to it, and it somehow remains unchanged.

\begin{prob}
What does it mean for a polygon to be regular?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How many ways can you write down the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ in
groups of 3, using all of the letters? Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How many symmetries does a regular $3$-gon have? Draw pictures and
list them.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How many ways can you write down the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ in
groups of 4, using all of the letters? Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How many symmetries does a regular $4$-gon have? Draw pictures and
list them.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How many symmetries does a regular $5$-gon have? Draw pictures and
list them.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How many symmetries does a regular $6$-gon have? Draw pictures and
list them.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How many symmetries does a regular $n$-gon have when $n$ is odd?
Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How many symmetries does a regular $n$-gon have when $n$ is even?
Explain your reasoning.
