\section{Rep-Tiles}

A \textbf{rep-tile}\index{rep-tile} is a shape that can be dissected
into smaller copies of itself. Conversely, you could use several
copies of a given rep-tile to make a larger version of itself.

\begin{prob}
Show that the following polygons are rep-tiles:
\[

\]
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
For each rep-tile above, compute the perimeter and area of the
original and larger polygons.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Explain how you know that any rep-tile will tessellate the plane.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Give an example of a polygon that tessellates the plane that is not a
rep-tile.
\end{prob}



\begin{prob}
Show that the following polygons are rep-tiles:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/reptile2.pdf}
\]
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
For each rep-tile above, compute the perimeter and area of the
original and larger polygons.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Every tessellation made by rep-tiles will have \index{symmetry of
scale}\textbf{symmetry of scale}. What does it mean to have \textit{symmetry of scale}?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Consider the tessellations made by rep-tiles you've seen so far. What
other symmetries do they have?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Do you think you can have a tessellation that has symmetry of scale
but no other symmetries?
\end{prob}
