\section{Painted Cubes}	

In this activity, we are going to test your skills at notating features
of a three dimensional object, using only two dimensions.


\begin{prob}
Suppose you have 8 cubes, all the same size. Two are red, two are
blue, two are yellow, and two are green. These 8 cubes can be put
together to form a larger cube where each face of the larger cube shows 
every color. Without building a model, how many \textbf{different} larger 
cubes can be formed with these 8 cubes?
\end{prob}
