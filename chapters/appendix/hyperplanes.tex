\section{Adventures Across Dimensions}	

In this activity we are going to investigate life in higher
dimensions. We'll start off nice and slow.



\subsection*{The Second Dimension}

If the universe was 2-dimensional, then we could represent it as the $(x,y)$-plane. 

\begin{prob}
Give three example of points in this universe.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
What is the formula for a line? If I give you two lines at random, how
could they possibly relate to each other? Give examples of each
possible case.
\end{prob}





\subsection*{The Third Dimension}

If the universe was 3-dimensional, then we could represent it as a
a $(x,y,z)$-plane.

\begin{prob}
Give three example of points in this universe.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
If I give you two lines at random, how could they possibly relate to
each other? Give examples of each possible case.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
What is the formula for a plane? If I give you two planes at random,
how could they possibly relate to each other? Give examples of each
possible case.
\end{prob}


\subsection*{The Fourth Dimension}

If the universe was 4-dimensional, then we could represent it as a
$(x,y,z,w)$-plane.

\begin{prob}
Give three example of points in this universe.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
If I give you two lines at random, how could they possibly relate to
each other? Give examples of each possible case.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
If I give you two planes at random, how could they possibly relate to
each other? Give examples of each possible case.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
What is the formula for a space? If I give you two spaces at random,
how could they possibly relate to each other? Give examples of each
possible case.
\end{prob}
