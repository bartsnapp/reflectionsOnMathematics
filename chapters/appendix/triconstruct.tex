\section{Triangle Construction}

Here is a triangle we'll use for this activity.  Let's call it $T$.

\begin{prob}
Use folding and tracing to construct a triangle $T'$ which is similar to $T$, but whose perimeter is three times larger.  Write down the steps you take, and justify each one.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Use folding and tracing to construct the circumcenter of $T'$.  Write down the steps you take, and justify each one.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Use folding and tracing to construct the orthocenter of $T'$.  Write down the steps you take, and justify each one.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Use folding and tracing to construct the incenter of $T'$.  Write down the steps you take, and justify each one.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Use folding and tracing to construct the centroid of $T'$.  Write down the steps you take, and justify each one.
\end{prob}
