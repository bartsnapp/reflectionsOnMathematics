\section{The Pinwheel Tiling}

In this activity we are going to investigate a very special rep-tile,
the \textit{pinwheel tiling}.\index{pinwheel tiling}

\begin{prob}
The pinwheel tiling is based on the following triangle:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/pinwheelBase.pdf}
\]
If the shortest side has a length of 1 unit, what are the lengths of
the other sides? What type of triangle is this?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Each time we ``inflate'' the pinwheel rep-tile, we view the new larger
triangle as being the shaded triangle in our base rep-tile. Inflate the triangle below three times. 
\[

\]
Check with your friend to see that you get the same result.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
In the picture below, shade-in (using colored pencils) the various
inflations of the shaded pinwheel rep-tile.
\[

\]
\end{prob}

We claim that the pinwheel tiling has no symmetry though any
isometry---yet it still has symmetry of scale.


\begin{prob}
Explain why any triangle in a pinwheel tiling is necessarly a part of
one, and only one, inflation.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Suppose there was an isometry that moved one triangle to another. HMMM
\end{prob}
