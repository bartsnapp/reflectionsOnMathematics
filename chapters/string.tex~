the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a
passing shape, from a spider's web.

\section{I'm Seeing Stars}\index{stars}

Can you remember when you first learned to draw a star? I can! I was first taught to draw a star like this:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/bartTri.pdf}
\]
But I wanted to know how to draw 5-pointed stars like the other
kids. So one day I taught myself to draw a star like this:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/bartTri2.pdf}
\]
This may seem like a silly way to draw this star---it certainly makes
me chuckle now. Let's see if we can give a theory for drawing stars
that will connect the two different stars above, teach you how to
draw some new stars, and learn a little more mathematics along the
way.

We'll start with $5$ points equally spaced on a circle:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/stfive.pdf}
\]
Think of these points as \textit{pins}, next we'll start at the top
and draw lines that we'll think of as \textit{strings}, moving
clockwise to the point two steps away each time:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/stfive1.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{../graphics/stfive2.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{../graphics/stfive3.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{../graphics/stfive4.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{../graphics/stfive5.pdf}
\]
Check it out, we got a star! If we had used pins and string to make
this star, we could have done it with one piece of string.

Now start with $6$ points equally spaced on a circle. Again, we'll
move clockwise two steps each time:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/stsix1.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{../graphics/stsix2.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{../graphics/stsix3.pdf}
\]
Oops, we've run out of points! No worries, just start again at one of
the points that hasn't been touched by a line yet, drawing lines and
moving two steps each time:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/stsix4.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{../graphics/stsix5.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{../graphics/stsix6.pdf}
\]
Ah! The other star! In this case, if we used pins and strings, we'd
need to use \textit{two} pieces of string. Hmmm---at this point I have
a question:
\begin{ques} 
How do we actually draw $n$ equally spaced points on a circle?
\end{ques}
\QM 
You can figure that one out---or just ask someone who is standing up at
the front of some room talking to themselves. Oh! And I have another
question:
\begin{ques} 
What happens if you put $n$ points, and connect them by moving $s$
steps each time?
\end{ques}
I'm feeling generous, so I'll help out with this one. Let's do a bunch
of examples together. I'm hoping that the following notation will help
out:\index{ns@$\star{n}{s}$}
\[
\star{n}{s}=\text{the star with $n$ points where we move $s$ steps}
\]
\begin{war}
Remember, $\star{n}{s}$ is a star \textbf{not} a fraction!
\end{war}
Armed with our new notation, let's draw the following stars!
\[
{
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\hline
 \includegraphics{../graphics/stseven.pdf} & \includegraphics{../graphics/stseven.pdf} & \includegraphics{../graphics/stseven.pdf} \\
\star{7}{1} & \star{7}{2} & \star{7}{3} \\\hline 
 \includegraphics{../graphics/stseven.pdf} & \includegraphics{../graphics/stseven.pdf} & \includegraphics{../graphics/stseven.pdf} \\
\star{7}{4} & \star{7}{5} & \star{7}{6} \\\hline 
\end{array}
}
\]

\begin{ques}
Do you notice any patterns? Why not share your observations with a
friend---or an enemy?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques}
Looking back, we see that some stars are one piece like
$\star{7}{2}$. Other stars are more than one piece, like
$\star{6}{2}$. What's the general rule?

\section{Drawing Curves}


\subsection{Envelope of Tangents}

Get out a piece of paper, a ruler, and a writing utensil. Really do
it!  Seriously! Anyway here is what we're going to do, draw two lines
that come to a point:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/mesh0.pdf}
\]
Now take both of those lines and mark the midpoints. Next connect the
midpoints with a line:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/mesh1.pdf}
\]
Each original line is now divided into two segments. Mark the
midpoints of those segments and cross-connect them:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/mesh2.pdf}
\]
If you continue this cross-connecting process, you'll get groovy pictures like these:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/mesh3.pdf}
\]
Over 2000 year ago, Apollonius of Perga explained why the curve we
just produced is a \index{parabola}parabola. Today we call what we
just drew an \textit{envelope of tangents}\index{envelope of
  tangents}.  If we cross-connect $n$ pairs of lines we'll call this
an \textit{$n$-line envelope of tangents}.

\begin{ques}
What does it mean for a line to be tangent to a curve?
\end{ques}
\QM


\subsection{B\'ezier Curves}

While some of us like pointy drawings, others like smooth drawings. To
make smooth drawings, we'll need the help of $\textit{Pierre
  B\'ezier}$, pronounced ``beh-zeeay.'' Here is the deal, Pierre
B\'ezier was an engineer with the Renault car company in the
1960's. He needed a convenient way to draw curves, a way that would
allow curves to be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Easy to render---meaning easy for computer (or person!) to
  reproduce the curve described by the artist.
\item Easy to transform---meaning easy to manipulate the curve with
  geometric transformations.
\item Easy to draft---meaning easy for an artist to shape a desired
  curve.
\end{enumerate}
Given two end-points, B\'ezier devised a way to work with
curves via a \textit{node} and two
\textit{control-points}:\index{node}\index{control-point}
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/bezier.pdf}
\]
With the end-points remaining fixed, the artist can move the node and
control-points to change the way the curve looks.  But how do those
so-called control-points actually control the way the curve looks?
Well the end-points, node, and control-points define a polygonal-path:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/bezierPoly.pdf}
\]
This polygonal-path in turn gives an envelop of tangents, which then gives
the desired curve:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/bezierMesh.pdf}
\]
While this may seem all fancy and highfalutin, this is the essence of
B\'ezier's method for drawing curves.  It has become so popular that
this is basically how curves are currently drafted using vector
graphics programs such as \textit{Adobe Illustrator} and
\textit{Inkscape}. Why are B\'ezier curves so popular? We'll see that
they satisfy the requirements above quite well.

\paragraph{Easy to Render}
A computer does not draw the parabola via an envelope of
tangents---however, the process we use above can be done by hand. The
key point is that one can obtain an arbitrary amount of smoothness to
the curve by simply adding  more lines to the envelope of tangents.



\paragraph{Easy to Transform}
Each curve is completely determined by the polygonal-path from the
first end-point to first control-point to the node to the other
control-point and the final end-point. Hence if I simply handed you
five points:
\[
(1,4)\to (4,2)\to (6,6)\to (7,8)\to(9,4)
\]
you can then draw a curve, and tell someone else how to draw the exact
same curve. Moreover, if you take a geometric transformation like one
of the matrices we've studied before, you could transform the entire
curve merely by transforming those five points.



\paragraph{Easy to Draft}
Of course, as you are aware, most graphic artists don't think much
about coordinates and yet are still able to draw B\'ezier curves with
impunity. This is really the genius of B\'ezier's method. By fixing
the end-points, one only need to know the position of the node and the
control points. So by using a mouse, an artist can move the
control-points and node to get a plethora of interesting curves.


\begin{ques}
What interesting pictures can \textit{you} make with B\'ezier curves?

both cases, explain how your drawings can be enlarged to actual-size.


\item Suppose you draw an envelope of tangents by continually taking
  midpoints as we did above. This will form a 1-line envelope of tangents,

  a 15-line envelope of tangents, and so on. What is the pattern? Explain
  why the pattern holds.
