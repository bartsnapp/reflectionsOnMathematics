\section{Design in a Line}

In design and architecture, a \index{frieze pattern}\textit{frieze}, pronounced
``freeze,'' is a horizontal band that is found near the ceiling or
roof. It is often decorated with a repeating design. Let's see some examples:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fpfrieze.pdf}
\]
Frieze patterns often have symmetry in their structure. In this chapter,
we will study this symmetry. At this point we will refrain from giving
a rigorous definition of a \textit{frieze pattern}. Instead, this will
be a result of our work in this chapter.

\subsection{Symmetries}

\subsection*{Translations}\index{translation}

Perhaps the most apparent symmetry that frieze patters can exhibit is
symmetry through \textit{horizontal translations}:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fptrans.pdf}
\]
We will not only insist that a frieze pattern always have
translational symmetry, but we will also insist that such a
translation is \textit{discrete}, meaning that it occurs in distinct
``hops'' of some minimal distance. So, for example, the while the
following patterns have minimal discrete translations, 
\[
2 examples (USE LETTERS)
\]
this pattern
\[
nonexample
\]
does not, and hence will not technically be considered a frieze
pattern. To be completely explicit: 
\begin{center}
\textbf{All frieze patterns have symmetry through some horizontal translation.}
\end{center}
\begin{dfn}\index{minimal translation cell}
A \textbf{minimal translation cell} is the smallest slice of a frieze pattern that will produce the entire frieze pattern through horizontal translations.
\end{dfn}

\begin{war}
The minimal translation cell of a frieze pattern is not unique! Consider
\[
image
\]
both
\[
2-egs
\]
are minimal translation cells.
\end{war} 



\subsection*{Horizontal Reflections}\index{horizontal reflections}

Frieze patterns can have symmetry though \textit{horizontal reflections}:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fphoriz.pdf}
\]
Some frieze patterns have symmetry though horizontal reflections, while
others don't.
\begin{ques} Can you identify the frieze patterns below with symmetry though horizontal reflections?
\[
6 egs some with horiz/vert sym.
\]
\end{ques}

\begin{war}
Always remember: A horizontal reflection reflects across a vertical line!
\end{war}



\subsection*{Vertical Reflections}\index{vertical reflections}


Frieze patterns can have symmetry though \textit{vertical reflections}:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fpvertical.pdf}
\]

\begin{ques} Can you identify the frieze patterns below with symmetry though vertical reflections?
\[
6 egs some with horiz/vert sym.
\]
\end{ques}

\begin{war}
Always remember: A vertical reflection reflects across a horizontal
line!
\end{war}




\subsection*{Glide Reflections}\index{glide reflections}

Frieze patterns can have symmetry though \textit{glide reflections}:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fpglide.pdf}
\]

\begin{ques} Can you identify the frieze patterns below with symmetry though glide reflections?
\[
6 egs some with horiz/vert sym.
\]
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
If a frieze pattern has symmetry through translations and vertical
reflections, must it have symmetry through glide reflections?
\end{ques}
\QM




\subsection*{Rotations}\index{rotations}

Finally, frieze patterns can have symmetry through $180^\circ$
rotations.
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fprot.pdf}
\]

\begin{ques}
Can you identify the frieze patterns below that have symmetry through $180^\circ$ rotations? 
\[
6 egs
\]
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
Suppose you have a frieze pattern with symmetry though both glide
reflections and $180^\circ$ rotations. Must this pattern also have
symmetry through horizontal reflections?

\section{Groups---Old and New}

\subsection{Old Friends}


We've already seen some groups. Now we're going to do something
that humans do really well, we're going to give them names.

\subsection*{Groups of Rotations}

Consider any regular $n$-gon. We'll let $\R_n$ be the group of
rotations of this $n$-gon. As an example, let $n=3$. As we've seen
before, if we let $\mat{R} = \mat{R}_{120}$, then 
\[
\{\mat{I}, \mat{R}, \mat{R}^2\}
\]
forms a group. 

\begin{ques}
What are the elements of $\R_4$? What about $\R_n$?
\end{ques}
\QM

\subsection*{Groups of Reflections}

Consider any regular $n$-gon. We'll let $\F_n$ be the group of all
reflections of this $n$-gon. So for a regular $3$-gon, we have
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fpsymTri.pdf}
\]
where $\mat{F} = \mat{F}_{x = 0}$, $\mat{F}' = \mat{F}_{y =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}x}$, and $\mat{F}'' = \mat{F}_{y =
  \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}x}$. Let's write out the group table and see what
we get, I've left it mostly blank. You can do this yourself
(seriously!):


\[
{
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{| c || c | c | c |c | c | c |}
\hline
\circ & \mat{I} & \mat{F} & \mat{F}'  & \mat{F}'' & \mat{F} \mat{F}' &  \mat{F} \mat{F}''  \\ \hline \hline
\mat{I} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &  \rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm}\\ \hline
\mat{F} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & &  \\ \hline
\mat{F}' &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & &  \\ \hline
\mat{F}'' &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & &  \\ \hline
\mat{F}\mat{F}' &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & &  \\ \hline
\mat{F}\mat{F}'' &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & &  \\ \hline
\end{array}}
\]

Checking with the definition of a group, we see that 
\[
\F_3 = \{ \mat{I}, \mat{F}, \mat{F}', \mat{F}'', \mat{F}\mat{F}',\mat{F}\mat{F}''\}
\]
is indeed a group!

\begin{ques}
How many elements does $\F_n$ have?
\end{ques}
\QM



\subsection*{Symmetry Groups}

We have a special name for the complete symmetry group of a regular
$n$-gon:

\begin{dfn} The \textbf{dihedral group}\index{dihedral
  group}, denoted $\D_n$, is the group of symmetries of a regular
  $n$-gon.
\end{dfn}

\begin{ques}
How many symmetries does a regular $n$-gon have?
\end{ques}
\QM




\subsection{New Friends}


Not only can we make groups from the symmetries of regular $n$-gons,
but we can also make group tables from the symmetries of frieze
patterns. These groups are called \textit{frieze groups}.\index{frieze groups}


\subsection*{The Groups $\boldsymbol{\Zt}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Zg}$}

Consider the following frieze pattern:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fptransGP.pdf}
\]
This pattern only has symmetry though horizontal translations. Let
$\mat{T}$ represent a translation of the minimal translation cell shown to the right. Then $\mat{T}^{-1}$ is a translation of the minimal translation cell to the left. From this we see that 
\[
\mat{T}\mat{T}^{-1} = \mat{I}.
\]
So we (meaning you!) can start to write out the partial group table:
\[
{
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{| c || c | c | c |c | c | c | c|}
\hline
\circ & \cdots & \mat{T}^{-2} & \mat{T}^{-1}  & \mat{I} & \mat{T} &  \mat{T}^2  & \cdots \\ \hline \hline
\cdots &\cdots & \cdots & \cdots  & \cdots & \cdots &  \cdots &  \cdots\\ \hline
\mat{T}^{-2} & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &  \rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &  \cdots\\ \hline
\mat{T}^{-1} & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & & \cdots \\ \hline
\mat{I} & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & & \cdots \\ \hline
\mat{T} & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & & \cdots \\ \hline
\mat{T}^2 & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & & \cdots \\ \hline
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots  &\cdots &\cdots &\cdots &\cdots & \cdots \\ \hline
\end{array}}
\]
We'll denote this group by:
\[\index{$\Zt$@ZT}
\Zt = \{\dots, \mat{T}^{-3}, \mat{T}^{-2},\mat{T}^{-1}, \mat{I}, \mat{T},\mat{T}^2,\mat{T}^3, \dots\}
\]


Now consider the following frieze pattern:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fpglideGP.pdf}
\]
This pattern only has symmetry though horizontal translations and
glide reflections. However, a minimal translation cell for this frieze pattern is
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fpglideMinTransCell.pdf}
\]
We'll let $\mat{T}$ represent the translation of this cell to the
right. On the other hand, a smaller piece of the frieze pattern will
generate the entire pattern though glide reflections.  If we let
$\mat{G}$ represent this glide reflection to the right, we see that
\[
\mat{G}\mat{G}^{-1} = \mat{I} \qquad\text{and}\qquad\mat{G}\mat{G} = \mat{T}.
\]
So we (meaning you!) can start to write out the partial group table:
\[
{
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{| c || c | c | c |c | c | c | c|}
\hline
\circ & \cdots & \mat{G}^{-2} & \mat{G}^{-1}  & \mat{I} & \mat{G} &  \mat{G}^2  & \cdots \\ \hline \hline
\cdots &\cdots & \cdots & \cdots  & \cdots & \cdots &  \cdots &  \cdots\\ \hline
\mat{G}^{-2} & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &  \rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} &  \cdots\\ \hline
\mat{G}^{-1} & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & & \cdots \\ \hline
\mat{I} & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & & \cdots \\ \hline
\mat{G} & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & & \cdots \\ \hline
\mat{G}^2 & \cdots &\rule[7mm]{13mm}{0mm} & & & & & \cdots \\ \hline
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots  &\cdots &\cdots &\cdots &\cdots & \cdots \\ \hline
\end{array}}
\]
We'll denote this group by:
\[\index{$\Zg$@ZG}
\Zg = \{\dots, \mat{G}^{-3}, \mat{G}^{-2},\mat{G}^{-1}, \mat{I}, \mat{G},\mat{G}^2,\mat{G}^3, \dots\}
\]


\begin{ques}
What is the connection between the group tables for $\Zt$ and $\Zg$?
\end{ques}
\QM

\subsection*{The Group $\boldsymbol{\Zgf}$}

Consider the frieze pattern:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fpverticalGP.pdf}
\]
This pattern only has symmetry though horizontal translations, glide
reflections, and vertical reflections. I claim that each of these
symmetries can be expressed as the combination of a horizontal
translation $\mat{T}$ and a vertical reflection $\mat{F}$. Then the
glide reflection is given by $\mat{T}\mat{F}$.

\begin{ques} Is $\mat{T}\mat{F} = \mat{F}\mat{T}$?
\end{ques}
\QM

Again, we (meaning you!) can start to write out the partial group table:

\fbox{TABLE IS NOT DONE!!!}
